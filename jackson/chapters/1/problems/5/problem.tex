\begin{question}

The time-averaged potential of a neutral hydrogen atom is given by

\begin{equation}
  \Phi = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{e^{-\alpha r}}{r} \left( 1 +
  \frac{\alpha r}{2} \right)
\end{equation}

where $q$ is the magnitude of the electronic charge, and $\alpha^-1 =
a_0/2$, $a_0$ being the Bohr radius. Find the distribution of charge
(both continuous and discrete) that will give this potential and
interpret your result physically.
