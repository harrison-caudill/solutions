\begin{question}

  A simple capacitor is a device formed by two insulated conductors
  adjacent to each other. If equal and opposite charges are placed on
  the conductors, there will be a certain difference of potential
  between them. The ratio of the magnitude of the charge on one
  conductor to the magnitude of the potential difference is called the
  capacitance (in SI units it is measured in Farads). Using Gauss's
  law, calculate the capacitance of

  \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]

  \item two large, flat, conducting sheets of area $A$, separated by a
    small distance $d$

  \item two concentric conducting spheres with radii $a$, $b$ where
    ($b > a$)

  \item two concentric conducting cylinders of length $L$, large
    compared to their radii $a$, $b$ where ($b > a$)

  \item What is the inner diameter of the outer conductor in an
    air-filled coaxial cable whose center conductor is a cylindrical
    wire of diameter 1mm and whose capacitance is $3 * 10^{11} F/m$?
    $3 * 10^{-12} F/m$?

  \end{enumerate}
