\begin{question}

  Each of three charged spheres of radius $a$,

  \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]

  \item one conducting,

  \item one having a uniform charge density within its volume, and

  \item one having a spherically symmetric charge density that varies
    radially as $r^n$ ($n > -3$),

  \end{enumerate}
  has a total charge $Q$. Use Gauss's theorem to obtain the electric
  fields both inside and outside each sphere. Sketch the behavior of
  the fields as a function of radius for the first two spheres, and
  for the third with $n = -2, +2$

\end{question}
