\begin{question}
  Using Dirac delta functions in the appropriate coordinates, express
  the following charge distributions as three-dimensional charge
  densities p(x).

  \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]

    \item In spherical coordinates, a charge $Q$ uniformly distributed
      over a cylindrical surface of radius $b$.

    \item In cylindrical coordinates, a charge $\lambda$ per unit
      length uniformly distributed over a cylindrical surface of
      radius $b$.

    \item In cylindrical coordinates, a charge $Q$ spread uniformly
      over a flat circular disc of negligible thickness and radius
      $R$.

    \item The same as part (c), but using spherical coordinates.
  \end{enumerate}
